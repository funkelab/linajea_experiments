Track annotations are split into two sets based on the side of the embryo.

tracks_side_1.txt is what Leo labeled the "train_set.txt"
tracks_side_2.txt is what Leo labeled the "test_set.txt"

I renamed them into two splits or sets because we will be training and testing on both.

Discarded.txt are the tracks that crossed the center line of the embryo, and thus are
not used for training or testing.
