Raw Data:

Originally, the data was stored in .klb format. Training can be done directly
from these KLBs. However, we chose to convert the datasets to zarr/n5 format,
which we find much easier to work with. The zebrafish data was also converted
into isotropic resolution ((3, 3, 3) compared to the original (6, 1, 1) and
stored this way to avoid re-computing on the fly. 

Track Annotations:

The original annotations as recieved from the Keller lab are in
/linajea_experiments/01_data/<sample #>/tracks/original/. The data arrived in different
formats for each sample, and different preprocessing was done to clean up and reformat the tracks
into a tab separated value text file, with columns t, z, y, x, cell_id, parent_id, track_id.
This text file is stored as tracks.txt in /linajea_experiments/01_data/<sample #>/tracks/ 
If appropriate, the tracks were separated into two disjoint sets of tracks that don't cross the center line
of the organism, stored as tracks_side_1.txt and tracks_side_2.txt in the same folder.

Additionally, in order to test sampling from divisions more frequently, we created files 
division_tracks.txt and daugher_cells.txt in the tracks folder.


DATA MANIPULATION AND PREPROCESSING

There are a number of python scripts in the /linajea_experiments/01_data folder that can
be used to preprocess, manipulate, or gather statistics about the data. 
 
The file "interpolate_and_split_data.py" is the script used to read in an xml file,
interpolate to caclulcate any missing time points, fit a PCA model to split the tracks
into two sides, and then write to a txt file. It has some dependencies that are not required
anywhere else, including a library Leo Guignard made to store tracks. See comments in code for more info.
