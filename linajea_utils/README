README: Scripts

Scripts named like *_nb.py are jupyter notebooks that have been converted to plain
python scripts using jupytext.

To view scripts as Jupyter Notebooks:

1) Install jupytext (available on pip, conda)
2) (Optional) Create an .ipynb file by calling `jupytext --to notebook <script>.py`
3) Start a jupyter server and navigate to the file in the web UI
4) Click on the file. It will automatically open the .py file as a notebook if you click on it,
although it will still save as plain text (as opposed to storing the output of cells).
If you chose to create an .ipynb file, it will automatically pair them and keep them in sync.

You can even edit the .py file in a text editor, and then refresh the view to see the changes
without losing your variables.
Turn off autosave in the jupyter view if you want to edit the .py file to avoid getting
out of sync.
